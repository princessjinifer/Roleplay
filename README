Roleplay
Alpha Builds (no version number yet)

After downloading unzip, and cd into the directory it creates.

Build it:
make

then execute:
./roleplay

then enjoy! ;D It isn't finished yet, so don't expect much from it... But do expect more to come ^_^

The bak folder is a backup of old files when I was making it a multifile program, I will most likely get rid of that later, or you can if you want, your choice :D
